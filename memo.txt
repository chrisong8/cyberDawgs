Project structure is set up in general. Almost certain we will use React frontend with navigation,
Flask API for backend where we will setup communication with Python NLP/AI work. 

Backbone of chatbot uses this kit: https://fredrikoseberg.github.io/react-chatbot-kit-docs/docs/
Handles a lot of frontend for us, but issues may include: styling, integrating with python stuff like 
passing in/handling user input/AI output, general unfamiliarity

TODO
Priority 1: Chatbot and Flask API for NLP model to communicate with website
    - need to research how to incorporate Python into JS (vaguely remember it's child spawn process or smt)
Priority 2: Interactive data viz on NIST CSF
Priority 3: Checklist (may be time-consuming and React-intensive from my research)
Priority 4: Barebones static content like team/FAQ page then adding style to everything

Research: Python integration, deployment, chatbot styling
